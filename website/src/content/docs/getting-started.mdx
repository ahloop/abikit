# Getting Started

Welcome to abikit! This guide will help you get up and running with abikit to generate multi-language SDKs from your smart contracts.

## What is abikit?

abikit is a powerful tool that automatically generates type-safe SDKs in multiple languages (TypeScript, Python) from your smart contract artifacts. It supports both Foundry and Hardhat projects and creates fully-typed, production-ready SDKs.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install abikit

The easiest way to install abikit is using our installer script:

```bash
curl -L https://abikit.ahloop.com/install | bash
```

Then restart your terminal or source your shell profile:

```bash
# For bash
source ~/.bashrc

# For zsh  
source ~/.zshenv
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your Foundry or Hardhat project and run:

```bash
# Build your contracts first
forge build

# Initialize abikit configuration
abikit init
```

This creates a `contracts.yaml` file with all your discovered contracts.

### 3. Configure Generation

Edit the generated `contracts.yaml` file to add your target languages:

```yaml
generation:
  targets:
    - language: ts
      outDir: ./sdk/typescript
      options:
        transport: viem
        packageName: my-contracts
    
    - language: python
      outDir: ./sdk/python
      options:
        packageName: my_contracts
```

### 4. Generate SDKs

Run the build command to generate your SDKs:

```bash
abikit build
```

This creates fully-typed SDKs in your specified output directories.

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete example of using abikit with a Foundry project:

```bash
# 1. Create a new Foundry project
forge init my-contracts
cd my-contracts

# 2. Build contracts
forge build

# 3. Install abikit
curl -L https://abikit.ahloop.com/install | bash
source ~/.bashrc

# 4. Initialize configuration
abikit init

# 5. Edit contracts.yaml to add targets
vim contracts.yaml

# 6. Generate SDKs
abikit build

# 7. Use your generated SDKs
cd sdk/typescript
npm install
```

## What's Generated

abikit generates:

- **TypeScript SDKs** with viem or ethers.js support and complete contract implementations
- **Python SDKs** with web3.py integration and Pydantic type safety
- **Type definitions** for all contract functions and events
- **Event watchers** with full log retrieval and parsing capabilities
- **Custom error decoders** for better error handling and debugging
- **Function selectors** and static mappings for contract interactions
- **Configuration management** with network support and runtime configuration
- **Factory helpers** for contract deployment
- **CREATE2 helpers** for deterministic addresses

## Generator Architecture (v0.2.3+)

abikit now uses modular generators for improved maintainability and extensibility:

- **Artifact Caching**: Copy artifacts to local `artifacts/` folder for faster builds and offline development
- **TypeScript Generator**: Splits generation into 10+ focused modules handling config, contracts, interfaces, types, signatures, errors, events, and utilities
- **Python Generator**: Applies the same modular structure with Python-specific implementations
- **Factory Pattern**: Easy to extend with new language targets or custom generators
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error recovery and validation throughout the generation pipeline
