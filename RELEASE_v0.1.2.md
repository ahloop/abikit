# abikit v0.1.2 Release Summary

**Release Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Version**: 0.1.2  
**Type**: Minor Release (Bug Fixes & Improvements)

## 🎯 Release Highlights

This release focuses on **generator reorganization** and **signature generation fixes** that significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of the abikit SDK generation system.

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Generator Architecture**
- Split monolithic generators into focused, single-responsibility modules
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Easier to extend and debug individual components

### 2. **Fixed EIP-712 Signature Generation**
- **TypeScript**: All signature files now generate correctly
- **Python**: Fixed forward reference issues and missing signature files
- Both languages now have complete signature utilities

### 3. **Enhanced Type Safety**
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors for network names with hyphens
- Improved Python type annotations and forward references
- Better error handling throughout the generation process

## 📊 Impact

### Before v0.1.2
- ❌ Signature files not being generated
- ❌ TypeScript compilation errors for hyphenated network names
- ❌ Python import errors for nested types
- ❌ Monolithic generator code difficult to maintain

### After v0.1.2
- ✅ Complete signature file generation for both languages
- ✅ TypeScript SDK compiles without errors
- ✅ Python SDK imports successfully
- ✅ Modular, maintainable generator architecture

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Changed
- **TypeScript Generator**: Reorganized into 5 focused modules
- **Python Generator**: Applied same modular structure
- **Utils**: Enhanced type mapping and forward reference handling
- **CLI**: Updated version to 0.1.2

```

## 🧪 Testing

### Verified Functionality
- ✅ TypeScript SDK builds successfully
- ✅ Python SDK imports without errors
- ✅ All signature files generated correctly
- ✅ Network configurations work with hyphenated names
- ✅ Forward references work in Python type models

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test TypeScript build
cd ts/generated && pnpm build

# Test Python imports
cd py/generated && python3 -c "from signatures import *; print('Success!')"

# Test full generation
abikit build --force contracts.yaml
```

## 📋 Migration Guide

**No migration required** - this release maintains full backward compatibility.

### What's New
- Generated SDKs will now include complete signature files
- Network names with hyphens will be properly quoted in TypeScript
- Better error messages for debugging

### What's Fixed
- Signature files now generate correctly for both languages
- TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Python import errors resolved
- Missing type definitions added

## 🎉 Ready for Production

This release significantly improves the reliability and completeness of generated SDKs. All major signature generation issues have been resolved, and the new modular architecture makes the codebase much more maintainable for future development.
